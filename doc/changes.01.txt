Wimbli fixes (now shows up when loaded from saved game)
Jugger shadows correct when eating

Pygmies hiding in trees now visible on map
Hordling distribution slightly modified
Confirmation/warning when deleting save games and
	before clearing out NVRAM


Changes as of 3/21 version:

Fixed hang when died with knights/archers around,
	and possibly when loading game when previous game
	had knights/archers
Disallow digging of ice in snow level (can dig water during summers)
Trident can no longer destroy flute
Volume back to original level, video volume now reasonable
Raised rates of knight/archer enchant sounds (were too low)
Fixed bugs where hordlings could disappear when:
	1) being hit by frogs or moving haunches AND
	2) hordling is already eating, or is doing something special
		(i.e., pygmy shooting, snowman throwing or kicking,
		shaman being a shaman!)
Moved map up when going to Vesh -- could see garbage at top
	of screen before
Found and corrected possible cause of Wimbli trident crash
