Susan,

The following bugs are fixed in your CURRENT version:

    A -- 36, 190, 292

    B -- 35, 37, 54, 58, 74, 79, 104, 113, 115, 305

    C -- 192, 195, 244, 277, 279, 317, 326

The following will be fixed in the NEXT version:

    B -- 216, 236, 257, 278, 290, 301, 319, 320
    
The following are not bugs (perhaps they are design issues):

    B -- 300, 308
    
    C -- 299, 315
    
    S -- 269
    
As for the WDS variety, the following are fixed in the CURRENT
version:

    A -- 193
    
    C -- 309
    
We were able to reproduce the crash in the Tree Realms.  We
found where it's crashing, but couldn't find a specific cause.
We did change a lot of the logic in this area since your CURRENT
version -- when we tried to crash again after the code changes,
we couldn't, so please attempt to duplicate the crashes with the
NEXT version (which will arrive today sometime).

Thanks,
