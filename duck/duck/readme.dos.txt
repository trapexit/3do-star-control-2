Dan and Mariano,

Here's the files.  "myduck" is my player (duck.c) plus some modified
versions of your files to simplify the VDL management.  I also commented
out some of the debugging in the source files of yours I had -- I removed
bugbuf and made DEBUGF conditional at compile time.

"src.new" is what you left with me, Dan.  There should be no changes
(unless I blew it!) -- I copied versions of the source into my directory
("myduck") as necessary.

Good luck and let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ken
